NextJS is a **framework for ReactJS**.

Here is the definition from the docs:
Next.js is a React framework that gives you building blocks to create web applications.

By framework, we mean Next.js handles the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.

Some of the big companies are using Next JS, such as Hulu, Uber, Tickermaster, Twitch, Netflix and Github just to name a few.

## Why would you use NextJS?

Because NextJS makes building React apps easier - especially React apps that should have server-side rendering (though it does way more than just take care of that).

These are just some of the reasons why you would try NextJS:

- File-based Routing
- Built-in Page Pre-rendering
- Rich Data Fetching Capabilities
- Image Optimization
- Much More

## File-based Routing
