1. React
2. React Router
3. Firebase
3. Axios
4. PM2
5. Material-UI
6. React Bootstrap

## Why build an Amazon Clone?

Because it gives insight to what a small team of two software developers can do with the help of external api's, css,
great knowledge of React, AWS, and Google's firebase authentication.

These are some of things you can do with our Amazon Clone: 

- Sign-In / Sign-Out
- Buy/Remove products from cart
- Navbar/Search Input
- Carousel on the home page displaying advertisements
- Account Page / change sign-in info
